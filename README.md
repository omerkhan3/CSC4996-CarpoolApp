How to run on your local machine:

Client-Side: 

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  If you don't have Cocoa Pods installed, run the command "sudo gem install cocoapods".
3.  Run command "pod install" in the directory you have cloned the repository.  This will generate a new "Pods" folder and "Podfile.lock" file based on the dependencies found in "Podfile".
4.  Run "CarpoolApp.xcworkspace" (not "CarpoolApp.xcodeproj") and run the simulator.
